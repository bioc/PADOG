Description: This package implements a general purpose gene set analysis method called PADOG that downplays the importance of genes that apear often accross the sets of genes to be analyzed. The package provides also a benchmark for gene set analysis methods in terms of sensitivity and ranking using 24 public datasets from KEGGdzPathwaysGEO package.
